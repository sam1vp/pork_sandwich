--README--

How to get started: 

1. Create a new rails project

2. Drop this into config/environment.rb (after the Rails::Initializer.run do |config| line, but before the "end" statement of that block)
  config.gem "pork_sandwich", :version => ">=0.4.5"

3. rake gems:install 
or
sudo rake gems:install

4. script/generate pork_sandwich_models

5. script/generate pork_sandwich_migration

6. rake db:migrate
(may have to comment the "with timestamp" stuff out in the migration.  Starts with "begin" and has a lot of execute statements in it.)

Pork Classes and db Objects can now be referenced throughout your project. See below for a description of the database schema and pulling methods. Happy porking.
